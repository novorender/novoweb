## Getting started

The default scene is Condos.  
Create an environment variable `REACT_APP_SCENE_ID={SCENEID}` to set a different scene as the default.  
There is no authentication in the current state of the app, so scenes has to be public.

Install dependencies  
`npm install`

Start dev server  
`npm run dev`

Create production build  
`npm run build`

Serve production build  
`PORT=5000 npm start`
